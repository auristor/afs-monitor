                     User-Visible afs-monitor Changes

afs-monitor 2.0 (unreleased)

    Initial tarball release, based on check_afsspace 1.16, check_bos 1.7,
    check_rxdebug 1.11, and check_udebug 1.3.

    If the salvager is running (such as when started manually with bos
    salvage), check_bos now reports a warning stating that, rather than a
    critical error showing the auxiliary status line.  Reported by Steve
    Rader.
