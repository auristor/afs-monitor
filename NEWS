                     User-Visible afs-monitor Changes

afs-monitor 2.2 (unreleased)

    The vos binary is installed in sbin by the Red Hat packages and the
    default upstream installation rules, so check in sbin as well as bin.
    Patch from Daniel Scott.  Also fall back, for all AFS binaries, to
    using PATH if the binary can't be found in known locations.

    Correctly handle checking quota of volumes with unlimited quota
    without a division by zero error.  Patch from Erik Dal√©n.

afs-monitor 2.1 (2010-12-08)

    Fix a bug in check_afs_space introduced in the previous release with
    checking all partitions on a particular server.

afs-monitor 2.0 (2010-12-07)

    Initial tarball release, based on check_afsspace 1.16, check_bos 1.7,
    check_rxdebug 1.11, and check_udebug 1.3.

    Rename check_afsspace to check_afs_space, check_bos to check_afs_bos,
    check_rxdebug to check_afs_rxdebug, and check_udebug to
    check_afs_udebug for more consistent naming and easier identification
    of the AFS Nagios probes.

    Add check_afs_quotas, which monitors AFS volumes for quota usage,
    either for specific volumes or for all volumes on a particular server
    (and optionally partition).  Based on a script by Steve Rader.

    Support checking a single partition in check_afs_space and print more
    verbose information about total, used, and free space in that mode.
    Format partition sizes using Number::Format if available.  Based on
    work by Steve Rader.

    If the salvager is running (such as when started manually with bos
    salvage), check_afs_wbos now reports a warning stating that, rather
    than a critical error showing the auxiliary status line.  Reported by
    Steve Rader.

    Print an UNKNOWN status on standard output on syntax errors in all
    scripts, rather than reporting the problem only to standard error.
    Check that the host to check was specified and report a syntax error
    if it wasn't.  Thanks, Tobias Wolter.

    Ignore "bos: running unauthenticated" in check_afs_bos, since bos
    status is always run unauthenticated.

    Add support for reporting warnings in check_afs_bos and report a
    warning if there is inappropriate access on server directories.  Patch
    from Steve Rader.

    If check_afs_bos is successful, report the number of instances running
    normally.  Patch from Steve Rader.

    Look for rxdebug in /usr/sbin and /usr/local/sbin since OpenAFS
    installs it into sbindir by default.

    Report the database version as extra information in check_afs_udebug
    if there are no errors or warnings.
