afs-monitor 2.0 (unreleased)

    Initial tarball release, based on check_afsspace 1.16, check_bos 1.7,
    check_rxdebug 1.11, and check_udebug 1.3.

    If the salvager is running (such as when started manually with bos
    salvage), check_bos now reports a warning stating that, rather than a
    critical error showing the auxiliary status line.  Reported by Steve
    Rader.

    Print an UNKNOWN status on standard output on syntax errors in all
    scripts, rather than reporting the problem only to standard error.
    Check that the host to check was specified and report a syntax error
    if it wasn't.  Thanks, Tobias Wolter.

    Ignore "bos: running unauthenticated" in check_bos, since bos status
    is always run unauthenticated.
