=head1 NAME

check_rxdebug - Check AFS servers for blocked connections in Nagios

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<check_rxdebug> [B<-hV>] [B<-c> I<threshold>] [B<-w> I<threshold>]
    [B<-t> I<timeout>] B<-H> I<host>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<check_rxdebug> is a Nagios plugin for checking AFS file servers to see
if there are client connections waiting for a free thread.  If there are
more than a few of these, AFS performance tends to be very slow; this is a
fairly reliable way to catch overloaded file servers.  By default,
B<check_rxdebug> returns a critical error if there are more than eight
connections waiting for a free thread and a warning if there are more than
two.  These thresholds can be changed with the B<-c> and B<-w> options.

B<check_rxdebug> will always print out a single line of output including
the number of blocked connections, displaying whether this is critical, a
warning, or okay.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-c> I<threshold>, B<--critical>=I<threshold>

Change the critical blocked connection count threshold to I<threshold>,
which should be an integer.  The default is 8.

=item B<-H> I<host>, B<--hostname>=I<host>

The AFS file server whose connections B<check_rxdebug> should check.  This
option is required.

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Print out this documentation (which is done simply by feeding the script
to C<perldoc -t>).

=item B<-t> I<timeout>, B<--timeout>=I<timeout>

Change the timeout for the B<rxdebug> command.  The default timeout is 60
seconds.

=item B<-V>, B<--version>

Print out the version of B<check_rxdebug> and quit.

=item B<-w> I<threshold>, B<--warning>=I<threshold>

Change the warning blocked connection threshold to I<threshold>, which
should be an integer.  The default is 2.

=back

=head1 EXIT STATUS

B<check_rxdebug> follows the standard Nagios exit status requirements.
This means that it will exit with status 0 if there are no problems, with
status 1 if there is a warning, and with status 2 if there is a critical
problem.  For other errors, such as invalid syntax, B<check_rxdebug> will
exit with status 3.

=head1 BUGS

The standard B<-v> verbose Nagios plugin option is not supported, although
it's not entirely clear what it would add.

The usage message for invalid options and for the B<-h> option doesn't
conform to Nagios standards.

=head1 CAVEATS

This script does not use the Nagios util library or any of the defaults
that it provides, which makes it somewhat deficient as a Nagios plugin.
This is intentional, though, since this script can be used with other
monitoring systems as well.  It's not clear what a good solution to this
would be.

=head1 SEE ALSO

This script is part of the afs-monitor package, which includes various AFS
monitoring plugins for Nagios.  It is available from the AFS monitoring
tools page at L<http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/afs-monitor/>.

=head1 AUTHORS

The original idea behind this script was from Neil Crellin.  It was
updated by Quanah Gibson-Mount to work with Nagios, and then further
updated by Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu> to support more standard
options and to use a more uniform coding style.
